# Deploying Sentiment Analysis

## Project briefing

In this project, I code a complete project using SageMaker. The objective is to use a web page to receive a review of a movie and return the emotion behind the text. The web page will send the review to the model and will receive the result. 

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/jlbasto/project-deploying-sentiment-analysis.git
    ```

2. You can check out the libraries that you'll need for the procedure in the notebook.


## Delete the Endpoint

Always remember to delete the endpoint after the use. Because you are charge for the time it's running, so don't forget to delete it.
